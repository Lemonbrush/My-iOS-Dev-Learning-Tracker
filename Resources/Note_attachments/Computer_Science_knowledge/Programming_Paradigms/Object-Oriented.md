# OOP

### Four Principles of OOP
The four pillars of object oriented programming are:

- **Inheritance:** child classes inherit data and behaviors from parent class
- **Encapsulation:** containing information in an object, exposing only selected information
- **Abstraction:** only exposing high level public methods for accessing an object
- **Polymorphism:** many methods can do the same task
