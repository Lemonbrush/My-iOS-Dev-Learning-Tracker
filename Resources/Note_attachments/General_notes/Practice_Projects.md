This is my old project I made with my friend. Just a simple clicker game where you tap the slime and evolve him. We were focused on smooth animations, beautiful graphics and great UX. Unfortunately, the project was abandoned  

`Made with:` Objective-C, SpriteKit, love  

`Concept art:`  
At some point we decided to chande Slime to little Flame
