# SOLID 

The SOLID concepts are:

- The **Single-responsibility** principle:
“There should never be more than one reason for a class to change.” In other words, every class should have only one responsibility.  

- The **Open–closed** principle:
“Software entities should be open for extension, but closed for modification.”  
 
- The **Liskov substitution** principle:
“Functions that use pointers or references to base classes must be able to use objects of derived classes without knowing it”. See also design by contract.  

- The **Interface segregation** principle:
“Many client-specific interfaces are better than one general-purpose interface.”  

- The **Dependency inversion** principle:
“Depend upon abstractions, [not] concretions.”
