## Xcode [Shortcuts](https://swifteducation.github.io/assets/pdfs/XcodeKeyboardShortcuts.pdf)
Xcode has numerous keyboard shortcuts that are worth learning. Knowing them can help speed up your iOS development, and it saves you from having to reach over to the mouse or trackpad.

On the Navigator Panel on the left side, the following keyboard shortcuts cycle through the different navigators.

- ⌘ + 0 = Show or Hide the Navigator Panel
- ⌘ + 1 = Project
- ⌘ + 2 = Source Control
- ⌘ + 3 = Symbol
- ⌘ + 4 = Find
- ⌘ + 5 = Issue
- ⌘ + 6 = Test
- ⌘ + 7 = Debug
- ⌘ + 8 = Breakpoint
- ⌘ + 9 = Report
The Utility Area on the right side of Xcode can also be toggled with the following keyboard shortcuts:

- ⌥ + ⌘ + 0 = Show or Hide the Utility Area
- ⌥ + ⌘ + 1 = File Inspector
- ⌥ + ⌘ + 2 = Quick Help Inspector
- ⌥ + ⌘ + 3 = Identity Inspector
- ⌥ + ⌘ + 4 = Attributes Inspector
- ⌥ + ⌘ + 5 = Size Inspector
- ⌥ + ⌘ + 6 = Connections Inspector
If you right click (control click) on the Storyboard in the editor, then you can select a zoom level. You can also use 2 finger pinch in your Mac's trackpad to zoom in and out of the Storyboard.
